# Open-Mini-Transat


Open Mini Transat is a open source initiative to make a Mini Transat 650 desigen that fits the open source approach. 

For the pursues of learning how fare we are able to build it oure self. 

There is a lot of unknown in the moment. 

The building manual. 
One of the things is learning of other peoples fauliers and the bedst practis for building it. 
Who long does it take to build a boat, price calculations and 
Building Matrials etc.

What is Open-source hardware?

Open-source hardware (OSH) consists of physical artifacts of technology designed and offered by the open design movement. 
Both free and open-source software (FOSS) as well as open-source hardware is created by this open-source culture movement and applies a like concept to a variety of components. 
It is sometimes, thus, referred to as FOSH (free and open source hardware). 
The term usually means that information about the hardware is easily discerned so that others can make it - coupling it closely to the maker movement.[1] 
Hardware design (i.e. mechanical drawings, schematics, bills of material, PCB layout data, HDL source code [2] and integrated circuit layout data), in addition to the software that drives the hardware, are all released under free/libre terms. 
The original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the design from the FOSH community. 
There is now significant evidence that such sharing creates enormous economic value [3] and can drive a high return on investment for investors. [4]

Since the rise of reconfigurable programmable logic devices, sharing of logic designs has been a form of open-source hardware. 
Instead of the schematics, hardware description language (HDL) code is shared. 
HDL descriptions are commonly used to set up system-on-a-chip systems either in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) or directly in application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs. 
HDL modules, when distributed, are called semiconductor intellectual property cores, or IP cores.

In the case of the open mini 6.50.
Wee have been giving some basics that is required by the Mini Transat commity. 
Bud there is a lot of unproofne to the design of the boat. 
The gives the ability for all to build a open source mini 6.50
To get the project on the road the first ting is to define the languages and measurement standards. 

The languages is English, the units of measurement is IS units. (ISO 31) and drawings is ISO 128.

Do to the open design the design files are made in Freecad.
